# MACHINE LEARNING

## In this course we were taught machine learning algorithm along with our own implementation of them.

---

### Part 1

In this part of the course we were assigned to **Classify images of clothing** from images of the [fashion MNIST dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/classification).
The dataset consists of 60.000 images of 10 categories of clothing and another 10.000 for testing purposes.

#### Purpose
<p> The purpose of this assignment was to study and experiment with the following classification algorithms and methods on a real dataset:

- **Nearest Neighbor k-NN** with Eucleidian distance and with cosine distance.

- **Neural Networks**

- **Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** with linear kernel, Gaussian kernel and cosine kernel.

- **Na√Øve Bayes classifier** with normal distribution

</p> 

#### Testing 
<p>
For Testing purposes we used the following evaluation metrics:

- **Accuracy** is the percentage of success of the decisions the classifier makes.



- **F1 score**

</p>
